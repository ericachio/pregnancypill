## NYU Sackler Health Informatics Final Project

Goal: Create an website that allows pregnant women to determine what medications they can / cannot take at what stage of pregnancy. Some medications are allowed in first trimester, but not allowed in the second and third. This website aims to provide an easy way for women to get reliable information without having to contact the doctor.

Data: A mockup small dataset created by a NYU OBGYN. 

How to use: Input expected due date and desired medication. The website will calulate approximately which trimester, and determine if the medication is safe or not safe.
